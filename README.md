# 🌸 Aishwarya Y K — HTML & CSS Portfolio Website

This is a minimalist and fully responsive portfolio website created using only **HTML5** and **basic CSS3** — without any JavaScript or frameworks. It reflects my personal brand, academic path, and technical skills as a student of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
